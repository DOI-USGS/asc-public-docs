    CTX Observation (Orbit 1472)

CTX collects data simultaneously with the HiRISE camera and CRISM
spectrometer. As the name suggests, CTX provides the wider context for
the data collected by the other two instruments. Scientists use images
from the other instruments to examine the details of Mars, but CTX
allows a better understanding of the terrain that encompasses these
details.

From an altitude of approximately 300 kilometers above Mars, CTX returns
surface images that are 30 kilometers across, with pixels representing 6
meters of the Martian surface.

## Processing CTX Data 

CTX has one CCD, so processing its data is similar to other instruments. 
Making an uncontrolled CTX observation mosaic includes:

- **Level 0 - Data Ingestion**
- **Level 1 â€“ Radiometric Calibration and Noise Removal**
- **Level 2 - Map Projection**


## Level 0 Processing - Data Acquisition & Ingestion 

The steps of level 0 processing are:

1.  **Obtaining Images** - Finding and downloading CTX image data.
2.  **Ingestion** - Converting an EDR image to the ISIS cube format.
3.  **Adding SPICE Data** - Helps compute geometric properties.

### Obtaining Images

??? info "CTX File Naming Conventions"

    Deciphering the filename can be helpful both when searching for data and
    also when managing files on your system. The PDS naming convention for
    EDRs is.

        # A typical CTX image filename
        P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.IMG

        # We will break it down as follows...
        PAA_BBBBBB_CCCC_XD_EEFGGGW.IMG

    Where:

    - **PAA**: Mission phase.  `P01`
    - **BBBBBB**: Orbit number.  `001472`
    - **CCCC**: Represests the center latitude in units of 0.1
        degree. 0 degrees is the decending equator crossing; 90 is the south
        pole; 180 is ascending equator crossing; and 270 is the north pole.  `1747`
    - **XD**: Command mode, ***XI*** for ITL or ***XN*** for NIFL.  `XI`
    - **EE**: Planned center latitude.  `05`
    - **H**: Latitude, ***N*** for north or ***S*** for south.  `S`
    - **BBBW** Planned center longitude in positive west. `146W`



??? info "Searching the PDS Image Atlas"

    The [PDS Image Atlas IV](https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/beta/search?gather.common.mission=mro&gather.common.instrument=CTX&gather.common.target=MARS) 
    can search for CTX images.

    To find CTX images of Mars, filter by:

    - Instrument: `CTX`
    - Target: `Mars`

    You may also want to add other filters, like *Orbit Number*, 
    or use the map panel to draw a bounding box around an area of interest.

    If you find an image you want, but have trouble downloading it, 
    take note of the filename/product ID and try finding it manually on a data volume.


??? info "Browsing by Volume"

    Online Data Volumes offers manual access to the image data archive.

### Ingesting CTX Data 

#### Importing CTX EDR images into ISIS

??? info "About EDR IMG and ISIS cube formats"

    In order to work with CTX data in ISIS, the CTX EDR file must be
    converted to an ISIS cube file so ISIS programs can read and process
    the data.

    EDR files should always have a file extension of .IMG. These files
    contain the image data as well as text describing the image data and the
    state of the instrument at the time the image was taken. The text is in
    the form of a standard PDS label located at the beginning of the file.
    Only the info needed by other ISIS programs is transferred from the PDS
    label to the ISIS cube label.  See examples of each below.

#### Adding SPICE Data

??? info "About SPICE"

    An important capability of ISIS is the ability to *geometrically* and
    *photometrically* characterize pixels in raw planetary instrument
    images. Information such as latitude, longitude, phase angle, incidence
    angle, emission angle, local solar time, sun azimuth, and a many other
    pixel characteristics can be computed.

    To compute this information, the SPICE (**S**pacecraft and **P**lanetary ephemeredes, **I**nstrument **C**-matrix and **E**vent
    kernel) kernels must first be determined for the image. These kernels maintain the spacecraft position and
    orientation over time as well as the target position and instrument specific operating modes.

    For more info, see [Spice Overview :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../../concepts/spice/spice-overview.md)

!!! example "Adding SPICE info with [`spiceinit`](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/spiceinit/spiceinit.html)"

    ```sh
    spiceinit FROM=P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.cub
    ```

    To add SPICE information to your cube, run 
    [`spiceinit`](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/spiceinit/spiceinit.html)
    on the image so that camera/instrument-specific applications
    (e.g., `cam2map` , `campt` , `qview` ) will have the information
    they need to work properly. Generally, you can simply run `spiceinit`
    with your input filename and no other parameters.


## Level 1 Processing - Radiometric Calibration and Noise Removal

Creating a level 1 image involves:

  - **Radiometric calibration** of the data so we have an image
    representative of an ideal image acquired by a camera system with
    perfect radiometric properties. Values in the resulting image
    represent the reflectance of the surface (I/F).
  - **Removal of systematic noise** from the image. For CTX, this noise
    appears as vertical striping, referred to as furrows, which occur
    under certain observing conditions, and tonal mismatches among the
    data sets collected by adjacent channels in a CCD.



### Radiometric Calibration 

??? info "About Radiometric Calibration of CTX Data"

    The CTX detector has a total of 5000 pixels, divided among an A channel
    and a B channel. The pixels alternate between the two channels: ABABABAB, etc. 
    Images from CTX may or may not include all pixels in the acquired image.

    There are special summing modes that are utilized
    on-board the spacecraft to average detector pixels to combine them into
    a single output pixel value. The value of the ISIS label keyword,
    SpatialSumming, indicated the number of samples that were summed and
    averaged to result in the pixel values stored in the file. 

    Dark current pixels are taken for each line and stored in the ISIS cube as a table,
    named "CTX Prefix Dark Pixels". During the calibration process, a dark
    current value is subtracted from the pixels in the image. The exact dark
    current value that is applied is dependent on the summing mode. You can
    also select the IOF parameter and output the pixel values as relative
    reflectance.

    See Also: [General Overview of Radiometric Calibration :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../../concepts/image-processing/overview-of-radiometric-calibration.md)


!!! example "Radiometrically calibrating an image with [`ctxcal`](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/ctxcal/ctxcal.html)"
    
    ```sh
    ctxcal from=P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.cub to=P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.cal.cub
    ```

### Noise And Artifacts 

#### Removing Vertical Striping Due to Even/Odd Dectector Readout 

!!! warning ""

    If the image has a **Summing Mode** of `2`, then do not run `ctxevenodd`.

## Map Projecting Images 

### Map Templates

To project an image to a map projection, 
set up a list of parameters based on the projection you wish to use.
Use [`maptemplate`](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/maptemplate/maptemplate.html) 
(or a text editor) to set up a **map template** defining the mapping parameters for the projection.

??? quote "Example Map Template" 

    The following is an example of a map template for defining the projection
    of an image of Mars to the sinusoidal projection.

    ```
    Group = Mapping
        TargetName         = Mars
        EquatorialRadius   = 3396190.0 <meters>
        PolarRadius        = 3376200.0 <meters>
        LatitudeType       = Planetocentric
        LongitudeDirection = PositiveEast
        LongitudeDomain    = 360
        
        ProjectionName     = Sinusoidal
        CenterLongitude    = 227.95679808356
        
        MinimumLatitude    = 10.766902750622
        MaximumLatitude    = 34.44419678224
        MinimumLongitude   = 219.7240455337
        MaximumLongitude   = 236.18955063342
        
        PixelResolution    = 426.87763879023 <meters/pixel>
    End_Group
    ```

### Projecting an Image 

[`cam2map`](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Application/presentation/Tabbed/cam2map/cam2map.html) 
converts a camera (instrument) image to a map projected
image. `cam2map` will automatically compute defaults for most of the
mapping parameters, so you only need to define a subset of the
parameters in your map template (e.g. ProjectionName).

!!! example "Projecting an image with `cam2map`"

    *With the cube so far as `*.lev1.cub` and a* **map template** *(like above) saved to `sinu.map`.*

    ```sh
    cam2map from=P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.lev1.cub map=sinu.map to=P01_001472_1747_XI_05S146W.sinu.cub
    ```
    
!!! note "Notes on `cam2map`"

    - Your cube must be data from an ISIS-supported mission.

    - The same map template **can be reused** for multiple images 
      by **removing** the lat/lon range parameters from your map template:
        - MinimumLatitude
        - MaximumLatitude
        - MinimumLongitude
        - MaximumLongitude

    - `cam2map` will **automatically calculate** parameter values,
      as long as the **projection name** is in the map template.

    - If planning to mosaick the projected images, make sure
        the **PixelResolution** is the same for all images. Some projections
        also require the **CenterLongitude** and **CenterLatitude** to be
        the same for a mosaic.
