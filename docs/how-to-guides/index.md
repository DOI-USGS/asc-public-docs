How-to guides are much like recipes in a recipe book. They show how to carry out a specific task quickly, and can be copy-pastable. Think of how-to guides as preemptive StackOverflow-like answers.

Use the table of contents on the left to start browsing guides.  Check out the above cards if you aren't sure where to start.  Use the search bar if you're looking for something specific.

??? quote "Want to write a how-to guide?"

    When contributing documentation, consider what category it should should go in.  Docs in the **how-to guides** category should: 

    1. Solve practical problems for more experienced users
    1. Offer more ambiguous starting points; they should be reusable in many different contexts 
    1. Can be much shorter than getting-started docs
    1. Some examples:
        - How-to: generate an ISD via loads with specific kernels
        - How-to: get GEOJSON from ISIS footprints
        - Cookbook of common operations in a library

    On the other hand, docs in the **getting started** category detail specific tasks for users who may not have much experience; docs in the **concepts** category provide an understanding of a topic without necessarily going into detail on how to carry out specific tasks.
