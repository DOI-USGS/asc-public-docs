## Before you Report an Issue:

  - **Is your ISIS up to date?**  
    Make sure you are running the most recent version of ISIS.
  - **Has your issue already been reported?**  
    Search for existing issues similar issues to yours. If you find a
    pre-existing open issue, you may add a note with your new
    information or just indicate you are also experiencing this issue.
    If you find a pre-existing closed issue, please start a new issue
    and relate it to the old one.
  - **Use GitHub!**  
    Use GitHub's issue tracking system to communicate with the ISIS Support
    Team. If we receive direct emails we may ask you to post a new
    issue.

## Step-by-step Issue Reporting:

1.  **Classify your Issue.**  
    Tell us if this is a Bug, a Feature Request, a Question, a
    Recommendation, a problem with Documentation, or a Crash that is
    stopping your work.
1.  **Title your Issue.**  
    Provide a clear but concise subject for your new issue. Consider
    including the program name (e.g., "destripe is missing reset icon in
    the toolbar").
1.  **Describe your Issue.**  
    When describing your issue, provide a clear description of the
    issue. We need as much information as possible to help us identify
    and fix the problem. Too much information is better than not enough.
    Feel free to use the markdown tools to better illustrate the issue.
    This is especially useful when quoting error messages or
    documentation.
1.  **Try to include these helpful details:**  
      - All steps necessary to reproduce the problem
      - Command line with the exact arguments you used
      - Spacecraft, instrument, and names of the input files
      - Is the issue consistently reproducible?
      - Your operating system or distribution name and version
      - The exact error message if you see one. If possible, copy-paste the error
        messages into the issue description.
1.  **Version.**  
    Include the ISIS software version you are working with.
1.  **Monitor the Issue.**  
    Keep a close watch on your email for changes in the issue status and
    for notes being added. If the support team needs additional
    information they will add a note to the issue with the request.

## Miscellaneous guidelines

1.  **Multiple Problems â†’ Separate Issues.**  
    If you have multiple problems, please create separate issues for
    each one.
1.  **Post files when needed, but mind the file size.**  
    If a screenshot or text file is necessary to illustrate the issue,
    attach one to your post, but please keep the files as small as
    possible.
1.  **No Ads.**  
    No advertising is allowed anywhere on the site. Any advertisements
    will be deleted immediately.
