# How-To Guides

How-to guides are much like recipes in a recipe book. Write how-to docs to solve specific problems quickly, sometimes copy-pastable. Think of how-to guides as preemptive StackOverflow-like problems.

## For Authors

Before you start writing a new How-To guide. Make sure what you are writing belongs here. These are similar to getting-started guides, in that they explain to users how to perform some valuable tasks with the software, but distinct in that they:

1. Solve practical problems for more experienced users
1. Offer more ambiguous starting points; they should be reusable in many different contexts 
1. Can be much shorter than getting-started docs.
