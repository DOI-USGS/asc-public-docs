# Contributing with Git

## Prerequisites

### Programming Language

Before contributing, you should have a basic understanding of the language a program is written in.  For example, ISIS is written in c++, and ALE is written in Python.

### Installing Git

If you don't have git on your computer, you will need to install it first.  You can run `git version` in your terminal to check if git is installed.  If it is not, install as appropriate for your system.

| System  | Installation                                                                                                                           |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | Download and install git for Windows from the [git-scm website (external)](https://git-scm.com/download/win).                          |
| Mac     | Mac installs git automatically when you run it from the terminal.  If you have Homebrew, you may install git via `brew install git`.   |
| Linux   | Install git using your package manager. For example, `sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu.                                                 |

Once git is installed, set your username and email:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "emailaddress@example.com"
