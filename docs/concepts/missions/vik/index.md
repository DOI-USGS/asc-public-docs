NASA's **Viking Mission to Mars** was composed of two spacecraft, Viking
1 and Viking 2, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander. The primary
mission objectives were to obtain high resolution images of the Martian
surface, characterize the structure and composition of the atmosphere
and surface, and search for evidence of life.

**Viking 1** was launched on August 20, 1975 and arrived at Mars on June
19, 1976. The first month of orbit was devoted to imaging the surface to
find appropriate landing sites for the Viking Landers. On July 20, 1976
the Viking 1 Lander separated from the Orbiter and touched down at
Chryse Planitia.

**Viking 2** was launched September 9, 1975 and entered Mars orbit on
August 7, 1976. The Viking 2 Lander touched down at Utopia Planitia on
September 3, 1976.


## Scientific Achievements

The Orbiters imaged the entire surface of Mars at a resolution of 150 to
300 meters, and selected areas at 8 meters. The Viking 2 Orbiter was
powered down on July 25, 1978 after 706 orbits, and the Viking 1 Orbiter
on August 17, 1980, after over 1400 orbits.

    **Viking 1 Orbiter image of Central Tithonium Chasma.**

    Mars Landslide lobes can be seen on the 6 km deep 
    canyon floor. Some layering is visible on the south 
    wall. The image is ~90 km across. North is at ~11:30.

**The Viking Visual Imaging Subsystem (VIS)** on the orbiter consisted
of twin high-resolution, slow-scan television framing cameras mounted on
the scan platform of each orbiter with the optical axes offset by 1.38
deg. Each of the two identical cameras on each orbiter had mechanical
shutters; a 475-mm focal length telescope; a 37-mm diameter vidicon
(video camera tube), the central section of which was scanned in a
raster (i.e. image) format of 1056 lines by 1182 samples.

A filter wheel between the lens and shutter held six color filter
positions:

- **blue** (0.35 - 0.53 micrometers)
- **minus-blue** (0.48 - 0.70μm)
- **violet** (0.35 - 0.47μm)
- **green** (0.50 - 0.60μm)
- **red** (0.55 - 0.70μm)
- **clear** (no filter)

The footprint of each image covers
roughly 40 x 44 km, acquired from an altitude of 1500 km. The
configuration of the cameras provided overlapping, wide-swath coverage
of the surface. Each pixel was digitized as a 7-bit number (0 to 127)
stored in the onboard tape-recorder, and later transmitted to Earth and
converted to an 8-bit number by multiplying by 2.
