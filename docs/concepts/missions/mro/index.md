    Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Artist's concept - NASA/JPL

NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2005, is searching for
evidence that water persisted on the surface of Mars for a long period
of time. While other Mars missions have shown that water flowed across
the surface in Mars' history, it remains a mystery whether water was
ever around long enough to provide a habitat for life.


## Science Goals 

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter seeks to obtain science data that will
provide researchers with information for locating safe landing sites for
future missions and tell researchers about the history of water on Mars.
The spacecraft instruments will zoom in for extreme close-up images of
the Martian surface in order to analyze minerals, look for subsurface
water, trace how much dust and water are distributed in the atmosphere,
and monitor daily global weather.

These studies will help determine if there are deposits of minerals that
form in water over long periods of time, detect any shorelines of
ancient seas and lakes, and analyze deposits placed in layers over time
by flowing water. It will also be able to tell if the underground ice
discovered by the Mars Odyssey orbiter is the top layer of a deep ice
deposit, or if it is a shallow layer in equilibrium with the current
atmosphere and its seasonal cycle of water vapor.

The orbiter's primary mission ended about three Earth years after
launch, in November 2008.  From FY2022 to FY2025, it is on its 
[6th extended mission](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/mepagapril2023/presentations/1315_Zurek.pdf). 
As of 2023, CRISM has been powered off, but other instruments remain fully or partially operational. 

During its two-year primary science mission, the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter conducted eight different science investigations at Mars. The
investigations are functionally divided into three purposes:

- Global Mapping
- Regional Surveying
- High-Resolution targeting of specific spots on the surface.

## Science Instruments

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **[HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) :octicons-arrow-right-16:](hirise/index.md)**  
  This high-resolution, visible-range camera can reveal small objects
  in the debris blankets of mysterious gullies and details of geologic
  structure of canyons, craters, and layered deposits.
- **[CTX (Context Camera) :octicons-arrow-right-16:](ctx-data.md)**  
  This camera provides wide area views
  to help provide a context for high-resolution analysis of key spots
  on Mars provided by HiRISE and CRISM.
- **MARCI (Mars Color Imager)**  
  This weather camera monitors clouds
  and dust storms.
- **CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars)**  
  This spectrometer covers the range of visible and near-infrared
  light, useful for identifying minerals, especially those likely
  formed in the presence of water.
- **MCS (Mars Climate Sounder)**  
  This atmospheric profiler detects
  vertical variations of temperature, dust, and water vapor
  concentrations in the Martian atmosphere.
- **SHARAD (Shallow Radar)**  
  This sounding radar probes beneath the
  Martian surface to see if water ice is present at depths greater
  than one meter.
